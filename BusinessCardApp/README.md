Project: Business Card App

This simple application is a foundational exercise in Jetpack Compose to create a digital business card layout. It showcases basic UI composition, theming, and resource handling.

Key Features and Technical Skills

Skill Demonstrated                           	Implementation
Declarative UI             	Built the entire UI using Composable functions (Column, Row, Text, Image, Icon).
Layout and Alignment	        Utilized Arrangement.SpaceBetween to push the main and contact sections to the top and bottom of the screen.
Resource Handling	        Successfully integrated a drawable resource (logo) using painterResource.
Vector Icons	                Used built-in Material Icons (e.g., Phone, Email, Share) from the Icons.Rounded set.
Composable Reusability   	Created the ContactItem composable function to easily reuse the icon-plus-text layout for all contact information.
Styling                 	Applied basic styling with Modifier for padding, sizing, and coloring.
